!Series_summary	"Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of human low grade epilepsy associated brain tumor tissue. The Illumina Infinium 450K and 850K Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450.000 and 850.000 CpGs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical brain samples. Samples included 280 cases with various brain tumor diagnosis including low grade epilepsy associated tumors and non-epilepsy autopsy controls."
!Series_overall_design	"Bisulphite converted DNA from the 280 (86 NEW) human surgical brain samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k and 850k Human Methylation Beadchip Arrays"
!Series_overall_design	"Diagnosis descriptions:  DNT: dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor; GG: Ganglioglioma; isomorpic astro.: diffuse astrocytome MYB- MYBL1 -altered; PXA: pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma."
